# Data Exploration & Transformation

## 🔍 Overview

Before any machine learning model can be developed, data must be understood, prepared, and transformed. This module focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing strategies, and feature engineering to improve model performance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Explore and visualize data to identify patterns and issues.
* Handle missing, inconsistent, and noisy data.
* Engineer new features and select relevant variables.
* Scale, encode, and transform data for modeling.
* Evaluate preprocessing effects on downstream models.

---

## 🛠 Techniques Covered

* Summary statistics and visualization.
* Encoding categorical data & feature scaling.
* Train-test splitting & cross-validation setup.
* Handling class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE).

## Data

The data used is the Home Equity dataset that is used for credit risk analysis and loan default prediction. It contains information on 5,960 home equity loan applications, and its primary purpose is to predict whether an applicant will default on their loan. The dataset has 13 variables, with `BAD` as the target variable for predicting loan default and an amount variable to determine how much was lost. Additionally, in the `/data` folder, you will find a data dictionary that describes the variable types for each varaible and a short description on the values of each variable.

## Run

To run the script, download `HMEQ_Loss.csv` from the data folder and store it alongside the `Pasaye_Assignment_1.py` script, so you do not have to change the path to the file in the script.
