# Data Exploration & Transformation

## 🔍 Overview

Before any machine learning model can be developed, data must be understood, prepared, and transformed. This module focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing strategies, and feature engineering to improve model performance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Explore and visualize data to identify patterns and issues.
* Handle missing, inconsistent, and noisy data.
* Engineer new features and select relevant variables.
* Scale, encode, and transform data for modeling.
* Evaluate preprocessing effects on downstream models.

---

## 🛠 Techniques Covered

* Summary statistics and visualization.
* Encoding categorical data & feature scaling.
* Train-test splitting & cross-validation setup.
* Handling class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE).

## Run

To run the script, download `HMEQ_Loss.csv` from the data folder and store it alongside the `Pasaye_Assignment_1.py` script, so you do not have to change the path to the file in the script.
