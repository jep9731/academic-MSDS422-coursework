# Neural Networks

## 🧠 Overview

This section introduced neural network architecture and training for predictive modeling, including image and sequential data tasks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build fully connected **neural networks** for tabular data.
* Train **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for computer vision tasks.
* Understand activation functions, backpropagation & optimization.
* Prevent overfitting using dropout and regularization techniques.

---

## 🛠 Techniques Covered

* Feedforward Neural Networks
* CNNs: convolution, pooling, feature maps
* Training with TensorFlow/Keras

---

## 📈 Metrics & Diagnostics

* Validation accuracy/loss monitoring
* Confusion matrix & precision/recall for classification

---

## Run

Each topic (i.e., neural networks, CNNs) will have their own folder with the associated Python file along with the data necessary to run the file, or a Jupyter notebook file that will pull the data directly from the Tensorflow package or have a separate folder with the necessary images for the CNN.
