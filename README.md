## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, I was be able to:

* Understand and explain the machine learning model development lifecycle.
* Prepare, explore, and preprocess data for supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Train, tune, and evaluate a wide range of machine learning models.
* Apply model diagnostics and evaluate performance using standard metrics.
* Implement feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
* Build deep learning models for vision and sequence applications.
* Communicate machine learning insights and recommendations effectively.
